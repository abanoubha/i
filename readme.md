# ~~i the installer~~

THIS PROJECT IS CANCELLED

__i__ stands for __install__. You can use `i` to install any software via any package manager.

TL;DR i is an abstraction over all other package managers available on Linux/MacOS.

## i wizard

- search for the_term
- show search results
- choose the package/app/program
- use default package manager for the distro, or suggest another one to the user to choose (install via blah-blah or do not install blah-blah-app).
- run the needed commands, give realtime feedback to user.

## Available As

- CLI : `i vim` to istall __vim__.
- GUI : `vim` then click search.
