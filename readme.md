# i the installer

__i__ stands for __install__. You can use `i` to install any software via any package manager.

TL;DR i is an abstraction over all other package managers available on Linux/MacOS.

This software is a work in progress - WIP - a.k.a It is not done yet.

## Why ?

If you used to apt or brew, and need to use dnf or swupd it is hard sometimes. But if you use __i__, it will be always the same.

## i wizard

- search for the_term
- show search results
- choose the package/app/program
- use default package manager for the distro, or suggest another one to the user to choose (install via blah-blah or do not install blah-blah-app).
- run the needed commands, give realtime feedback to user.

## Available As

- CLI : `i vim` to istall __vim__.
- GUI : `vim` then click search.
